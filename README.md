# SCIDX Streaming

SCIDX Streaming is a powerful yet easy-to-use Python library that helps you work with live data on the sciDX platform. Whether you're creating, managing, or consuming real-time streams, this library simplifies the process. It's designed to make streaming accessible and efficient, so you can focus on using your data rather than struggling to manage it.

# Point Of Presence API (POP API)

The POP API is your gateway to managing streaming resources. It allows you to create, update, and retrieve essential data streams and services within the Point of Presence (POP) network. Whether you're setting up new data sources or interacting with existing ones, this API makes it straightforward and hassle-free to keep your data flowing.
